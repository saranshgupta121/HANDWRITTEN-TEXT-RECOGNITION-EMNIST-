# HANDWRITTEN-TEXT-RECOGNITION-EMNIST-
                                    Predicts handwritten words using CNN.
                                    
DESCRIPTION
The project aims at providing efficient solution to handwritten text recognition using new techniques of DEEP LEARNING AND IMAGE PROCESSING(Computer Vision).EMNIST dataset which is an extension of MNIST dataset is used.The training set has 697932 images and test set has 116323 of uppercase and lowercase alphabets and digits from 0 -9 which are mapped to their corresponding classes.Before feeding the dataset to the neural network(model) it required preprocessing like transposing the images and applying various filters.Two seperate Jupyter files have been included. modeltrain.ipynb contains creation and training of the model and segment.ipynb contains prediction of words using the created model.

An interface for this model is provided in the form of android app.
